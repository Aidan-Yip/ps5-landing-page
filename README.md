# PS5 landing page
Website dev project showcasing my skills in responsive design.

Ver 2 includes an improved mobile experience that is more fluid and responsive.

Nav bar is still a WIP. The PS5 logo image interfears with the nav elemeants. I have yet to figure out the cause and have tried flexbox and position functions to remedy it to no avail.
